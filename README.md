## Laboratory Activities for Topic 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

Lab Activity 1: Overview of Machine Learning Applications

Objective: Familiarize students with various applications of machine learning in real-world scenarios.

Instructions:

•    Research and identify at least three different applications of machine learning across various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, marketing).

•    Create a presentation summarizing each application, including:

o    The problem being solved

o    The type of machine learning used (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)

o    The impact of the solution

## WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms trained on data sets to create models that enable machines to perform tasks that would otherwise only be possible for humans, such as categorizing images, analyzing data, or predicting price fluctuations.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Machine Learning: Algorithms learn from labeled data with tags, like identifying flower types from tagged photos, to make predictions or classifications.

2. Unsupervised Machine Learning: Algorithms analyze unlabeled data to find patterns on their own, like discovering user behavior trends from raw social media data.

3. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning: Algorithms use a mix of small labeled data and large unlabeled data to improve accuracy, such as training a speech recognition system with some labeled and much more unlabeled speech data.

4. Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms learn through trial and error, getting feedback to improve their performance over time, like learning to play chess better by playing many games.

###  Transportation: Autonomous Vehicles

**Problem Being Solved:** Developing self-driving cars that can navigate safely and efficiently.

**Type of Machine Learning Used:** Reinforcement Learning

**Impact of the Solution:** Autonomous vehicles use machine learning algorithms to process sensor data and make real-time driving decisions. This technology has the potential to reduce traffic accidents, improve fuel efficiency, and provide mobility solutions for people unable to drive.

###  Environmental Science: Climate Change Modeling

**Problem Being Solved:** Predicting climate change patterns and impacts.

**Type of Machine Learning Used:** Supervised Learning

**Impact of the Solution:** Machine learning models analyze vast amounts of climate data to predict future climate scenarios. This helps scientists and policymakers understand potential impacts and develop strategies to mitigate adverse effects, such as extreme weather events and rising sea levels.

###  Entertainment: Personalized Recommendations

**Problem Being Solved:** Providing users with personalized content recommendations.

**Type of Machine Learning Used:** Unsupervised Learning

**Impact of the Solution:** Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify use machine learning to analyze user preferences and behavior. By recommending content tailored to individual tastes, these platforms enhance user satisfaction and engagement, leading to increased customer retention.

### Traffic Classification in Network

**Problem being Solved:** Different types of network traffic, such as web hosting (HTTP), file transfers (FTP), secure browsing (HTTPS), video streaming (HLS), and terminal services (SSH), have distinct patterns of bandwidth usage. For instance, FTP transfers large amounts of data continuously, while video streaming uses data in chunks with buffering. When these various types of traffic run simultaneously without any management, temporary network congestion or blockages may occur.

**Type of Machine Learning Used:** Supervised Learning

**Impact of the Solution:** To prevent network congestion, machine learning classifiers can analyze and identify different types of traffic. These models can then adjust network parameters, such as bandwidth allocation and data caps, to optimize performance. By intelligently scheduling requests and dynamically adjusting bandwidth, network efficiency can be significantly improved.
